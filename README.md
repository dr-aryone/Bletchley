Python Mastermind game clone with Tkinter GUI

With contributions from CMSteffen

This game is playable, however, there is a little bug
that I can't seem to track down where sometimes the 
game does not recoginze that you got the solution correct,
but this only happens on the last row.

Also I cannot find a way to restart a new game, it is beyond
my knowledge, I only started learning Python in August 2018.

If anyone can help solve these two problems it could be a very nice game.
